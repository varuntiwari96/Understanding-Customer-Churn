# Understanding-Customer-Churn
Understanding the Factors Linked to Customer Churn in the Automotive Industry
### Overview

This repository delves into the factors contributing to customer churn in the automotive industry and explains the impact of these factors using Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, particularly SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). The project aims to not only predict customer churn with high accuracy but also to provide a transparent understanding of the underlying drivers influencing customer behavior. By leveraging SHAP, we break down complex machine learning models into comprehensible insights, empowering businesses to implement targeted retention strategies based on interpretable model outputs.

### Dataset Information

1) Source: The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, consists of synthetic data that emulates customer information due to privacy constraints.
2) Size: 100,000 records with 22 features, including demographic details, financial data, and churn status.
3) Class Imbalance: The dataset exhibits a skewed distribution, with more non-churning customers than churning ones.
