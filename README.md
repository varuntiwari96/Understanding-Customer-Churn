# Understanding-Customer-Churn
Understanding the Factors Linked to Customer Churn in the Automotive Industry
### Overview

This repository delves into the factors contributing to customer churn in the automotive industry and explains the impact of these factors using Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, particularly SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). The project aims to not only predict customer churn with high accuracy but also to provide a transparent understanding of the underlying drivers influencing customer behavior. By leveraging SHAP, we break down complex machine learning models into comprehensible insights, empowering businesses to implement targeted retention strategies based on interpretable model outputs.
